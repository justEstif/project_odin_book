# user

- The user page

  - show all the users in the website
  - show some indication of friends vs requests sent vs requests received vs others
  - this also needs pagination

- The user page should show the all the users and their relationship to the current user

- Two ways to do this:

  1. the db returns the users according to their relationship to the user

     - get all the friends
     - get all the sent requests
     - get all the received requests
     - get all the rest

  - pros:

    - clear separation of which is which

    - cons:
      - not easy to randomize
    - hard to paginate

2. the users routes get all the friends

   - the send a request to check their relation ship

   - pros:
   - randomized
   - easy to paginate

- cons
  - the client has to make multiple requests to the api
    - to get all users
    - to get relationship
