# user

- The user page

  - show all the users in the website
  - show some indication of friends vs requests sent vs requests received vs others
  - this also needs pagination

- The user page should show the all the users and their relationship to the current user

- Two ways to do this:

  1. the db returns the users according to their relationship to the user

     - get all the friends
     - get all the sent requests
     - get all the received requests
     - get all the rest

  - pros:

    - clear separation of which is which

    - cons:
      - not easy to randomize
    - hard to paginate

2. the users routes get all the friends

   - the send a request to check their relation ship

   - pros:
   - randomized
   - easy to paginate

- types of relation with user

  - friend
    - actions:
      - unfriend
  - send request
    - sent request
    - delete request
  - receive request
    - accept request
    - deny request

- Add Friend _Button_ => send request
- Accept Request _Button_ => accept received request
- Reject Request _Button_ => don't accept received request
- Remove Friend _Button_ => unfriend

```javascript
const button = () => {
  const { trigger: deleteFriend } = useSWRMutation(
    `/api/users/${currentUserId}/friends/${userData.id}`,
    deleteRequest
  );

  // based on the relation trigger function
  return (
    <div>
      <p></p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

# Designing a single user on the users page

- What is the response from `/api/users`?

```typescript
type TGetResponse = {
  relation: "user" | "received-request" | "sent-request" | "friend" | "none";
  profile: {
    name: string;
    image: string;
  };
  id: string;
};
```

- instead of starting with the shell, start with a piece of actual functionality

1. Pick a feature

- Component: User on the users page

2. Think about what the interface for that feature needs

- image component to show the profile image
- text component: name
- pair button components:

```
    send friend               | don't recommend
    accept friend request     | deny friend request
    pending friending request | delete friend request
```
