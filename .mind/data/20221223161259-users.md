- Should you include the identifier in the post request or create an api route?

# TODO

- [ ] add pagination to the GET `/users` route
  - get only a certain number of users at once
- [ ] how to deal with the order of users?

-> get all users
--> get user friends
--> get user sent-requests
--> get user received-requests

-> if user is a friend
--> show some indication

-> if user sent-request
--> show some indication

-> if user received-request
--> show some indication
